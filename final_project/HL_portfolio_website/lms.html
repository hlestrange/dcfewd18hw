      <h3>Coins For Rewards</h3>
      <div class="color-strip"></div>
      <p>In the app, learners are awarded coins for completing courses and contributing to discussions within the community. As a learner earns more coins, he or she earns badges and gains levels of experience. The Rewards feature was developed to entice learners to take more courses by enabling them to redeem their coins for rewards offered by their company. Rewards can be anything from a company t-shirt to wearable tech!</p>

      <h3>Transaction History</h3>
      <div class="color-strip"></div>
      <p>This feature was developed in concert with Rewards. It's primary purpose is to show a user a historical record of which rewards he or she has redeemed as well as coins earned from posting helpful discussion comments and completing courses.</p>

      <div class="color-strip"></div>
      <p>Within the admin side of the app, an admin can create multiple rewards, view the status of active rewards, and see a history of those that have expired. Upon diving deeper, an admin can view and export a list of learners that have redeemed a reward. The columns within the list of learners are sortable, allowing the admin to view the information in different ways.</p>

      <h3>Course Prerequisites</h3>
      <div class="color-strip"></div>
      <p>This proof of concept was created to solve the need for a prescribed learning journey, where a learner is required to complete courses in a certain order. Once a courseâ€™s prerequisites are completed, that course becomes unlocked. As the user progresses, their progress is shown visually on each course tile and in a progress bar at the top.</p>
